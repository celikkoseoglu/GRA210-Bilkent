# Bilkent GRA210 - Web Design Term Project

This is my term project for GRA210 Web Design. This course primarily focuses on design languages for websites. It covers Google's Material Design and some other design patterns.

The course does not require any git knowledge or it does not require you to share your project on GitHub. I'm just sharing this to give you an idea about how the term projects look and what to expect from them.

Good luck with your courses!
